## Quickstart

### Codefx installation validation

[Codefx CLI 0.164.0](https://github.com/hitmux/codefx/releases/tag/rust-v0.164.0) is a stable release. Cross-platform installer hardening is undergoing native validation:

| Platform | Package | Real installation and daemon checks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Linux x86_64 / ARM64 (musl) | Published | Passed |
| macOS Apple Silicon | Published | Passed |
| Windows x64 | Published | Installation and repeat installation passed; daemon validation in progress |
| macOS Intel / Windows ARM64 | Building | Pending |

One-command replacement instructions are paused while the complete platform validation finishes. Keep your existing Codex installation. The revised installers validate the package before changing commands and retain existing package-manager registrations.
